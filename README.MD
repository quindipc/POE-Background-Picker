# Path of Exile - Background Picker

This was a 100Devs Javascript project. I love playing Path of Exile so I wanted to design the background picker to show the starter classes that can be played on the game. I made this project as a way to practice and understand basic Javascript functions.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned how to code basic Javascript functions and attach them to the images. It took me an hour to get the images to appear and learned that sometimes with programming, spelling error in syntax can happen and that may be why my code wasn't working. 

### Continued development

I am enjoying creating small projects like this and will continue to stylize projects towards my interests! I will also try and do better with catching spelling and syntax errors. :)
